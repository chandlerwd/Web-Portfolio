My older sister recently graduated with a degree in Art Education (B.F.A.) from Ohio Wesleyan University and now works as a middle school art teacher for 3rd-6th grade students full-time; for my web portfolio, I wanted to create a space in which I am able to briefly introduce my sister's art experience as well as showcase photos of some of the artwork that she is most proud of because she is such a great artist! In terms of the purpose of this portfolio, I want those who appreciate the arts to possibly gain a sense of inspiration for their own artwork and at the same time display my sister's hard work. Therefore, I intend the site's target audience to be other artists, art teachers, and supporters/admirers of the arts. I'm thinking that people might encounter this web portfolio through my sister's school website, the website of a local art center, or as a feature on the Cleveland Art Museum website (we live in CLE). The site includes a Home page where the artist's name, most recent education, and current job title are displayed clearly. I also included an About Me tab in which I had my sister write short introduction about her experience working with art. Finally, the Work tab exhibits photos of some of the various pieces that my sister has worked on and completed over the years. I wanted to keep this portfolio relatively simple in terms of content, while including some fun colors and design choices, in order to best display my sister's dedication to the world of art.
